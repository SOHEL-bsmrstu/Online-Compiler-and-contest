            <p><blockquote style="border: none;">Hi and welcome to the online compiler. Nowadays everything is going online. These are the days of internet of things. Everything you need is going online and available online. So why not bring to the internet an <b style="color: blue;">Online IDE</b> that takes your code and gives the result.</blockquote>
            <blockquote  style="border: none;">There are quite a few advantages of using an online compiler instead of the offline ones -</blockquote>
            <blockquote  style="border: none; margin-left: 100px;"> 1. You get rid of hassles of downloading and installing softwares.<br>
                2. Even if you install, they are gonna be outdated soon. But here you are also outsourcing that hassle to us.<br>
                3. Program in so many languages at once.<br>
                4. Interacting with a large community is always wonderful.</blockquote>
            <blockquote  style="border: none;"> But there can be some cases where online Editor may not serve your purpose. For security reasons theonlinecompiler makes some restrictions on user code. Also if you intend to develop big application, only an offline IDE such as Visual studio can help. However we believe that online things are useful more often than not. So go on enjoying your favorite online c compiler and others.</blockquote>
            <blockquote  style="border: none;"><b style="color: blue;"><i>How online C/C++ Compiler works</i></b><br><br>The online c compiler is powered by gcc which runs your code in real time and also processes the input which you give. Below you will also find a complete list of all the compilers/interpreters which power our Online IDE with many other languages like Python, Java, PHP etc.<br><br>These compilers are fired as soon as users asks to compile his code. The browser passes user code and language details to the server via a Javascript call. In its turn, server fires the desired compiler and passes the user code and inputs to it. Then the output is relayed to the browser.</blockquote></p>
        <blockquote  style="border: none;"><b style="color: blue;"><i>Whats different from others</i></b><br><br>We use a very sophisticated and innovative method that helps us deliver the code output with such a small delay. Some users have said that your's is the fastest online compiler and interpreter they have worked upon.</blockquote></p>
    <blockquote  style="border: none;"><b style="color: blue;"><i>List of Compilers we use</i></b><br>
        <ul>
            <li><b>C : </b>GCC 4.9.2</li>
            <li><b>C++ : </b>GCC++ 4.9.2</li>
            <li><b>Java : </b>JDK 8 update 111</li>
        </ul>
        <br>Support for more languages coming soon.<br><br>So this was all what about our Online C and other compilers and how the IDE compiles them and produces the output. Hope that you enjoyed reading and learning this. Time to go to online compiler. Happy online coding.</blockquote></p>
